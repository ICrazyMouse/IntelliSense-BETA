<h1>IntelliSense (BETA)</h1>
<p>A project that emulates Visual Studio's IntelliSense functionalities for C#.<p>
<br>
  <h3>DISCLAIMERS:</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>This is not a substitute for IntelliSense and is not stable, this project is just an experiment.</li>
  <li>The program doesn't flag all errors, and may flag code that does not have errors.</li>
  </ul>
<br>
<h3>Running and Debugging:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Change the string <code>pathToScan</code> at line 10 in <code>Program.cs</code> to whatever file path you want to scan.</li>
  <li>All of the logic is done in <code>IntelliSense.cs</code>, and the scanning is done in the <code>scanLine()</code> function</li>
</ul>
